# TourismPythonProject

Platform & Language Used:

Platform: Flask

Scripting Language: Python

Database: SQLalchemy 

We have used Python as our back-end where there is a functioning of filling out form for the home booking. The
data is getting stored successfully and SQLite Browser can be used to see the data in the database.

When we go on the page of Home List for booking i.e. on Vancouver or Victoria then on click of "Book Now" button.
We get the form for filling out the details and over there the whole functioning is done by using python.

There is also a functioning of mail sending to the entered mail in the form. The mail is for the confirmation
that the payment has been done successfully.

To run the files there is a need to install the flask in the system.
